Sessions show a pattern of targeted searches for specific products, services, or information (VAT numbers, car warnings, sashimi-grade fish). The user appears to balance personal projects (cooking, fitness, programming) with professional research in finance and energy sectors.",
  "summary_big": "The browsing history reveals a user engaged in diverse but purposeful activities. Travel planning includes route research from Spain to Monaco and vineyard stays, while shopping sessions focus on specific retailers and product verification (VAT lookups for fashion brands, eyewear in Lucknow, sashimi-grade fish sourcing). Professional interests span finance (Crake Asset Management interview prep, AtomInvest), energy sector procurement research, and health-tech communities on Slack. Personal projects include troubleshooting a Fiat Panda in Italy, learning Scratch programming with medical clipart, researching gym locations, and preparing tuna ceviche. The user consistently performs detailed, multi-step research within each session, suggesting methodical information-gathering habits. Sessions rarely show aimless browsing; instead, they reflect specific goals like solving immediate problems (car warning lights), vetting purchases (VAT verification), or acquiring specialized knowledge (upstream oil vs. procurement distinctions).",
