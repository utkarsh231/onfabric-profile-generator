    "### Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to create an **accurate representation of a user** based on their Google search history.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is in `./search_history.json`. This contains a list of searches made by a single person over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does \"accurate\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accurate** means understanding which searches are **signal** and which are **noise**. Not every search reflects who someone is. Your job is to separate the meaningful from the incidental and build a coherent picture of this person.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong solution might surface insights like:\n",
    "- **Fashion preferences**: What styles, brands, or aesthetics do they gravitate toward?\n",
    "- **Travel**: Where have they been? Where are they planning to go?\n",
    "- **Daily life**: What occupies their time—at work and for leisure?\n",
    "- **Life transitions**: Are they moving? Starting a new job? Planning a wedding?\n",
    "- **Location**: Where do they live?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not an exhaustive list. The point is to go beyond surface-level keyword extraction and demonstrate that you *actually understand* this person.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What could a \"representation\" look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to represent a user. A few examples:\n",
    "- A **personal knowledge graph** capturing entities, relationships, and context\n",
    "- A **single embedding** that encodes the user's preferences in a vector space\n",
    "- An **LLM fine-tuned** on the user's data\n",
    "- An **agent** that uses RAG to answer questions about the user\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just starting points—come up with your own if you have a better idea. The specific representation you choose matters less than **why** you chose it and how well it captures what's meaningful about this person.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dummy approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is what we consider a **dummy** approach:\n",
    "1. Embed all searches\n",
    "2. Cluster them by topic\n",
    "3. Label each cluster and call it a \"user interest\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This is mechanical. It doesn't distinguish signal from noise, doesn't capture nuance, and doesn't produce insights that feel *true* about a real person.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What makes an interesting approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "We're not looking for a \"correct\" answer, there probably isn't one. We're looking for **evidence of thinking**:\n",
    "- Why did you choose this method over alternatives?\n",
    "- What assumptions are you making, and why are they reasonable?\n",
    "- How do you handle ambiguity in the data?\n",
    "- What did you try that didn't work?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The reasoning behind your approach is as important as the solution itself.** Show your work. Explain your decisions. If you explored dead ends, include them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to include the cell output in the final commit. We will **not** execute the notebook ourselves."
