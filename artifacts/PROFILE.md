## Kitchen Islands & Cabinets (mass=151.91)

This topic represents a user's interest in home and office furniture, with a strong focus on IKEA products and kitchen islands. The user has searched for IKEA multiple times across different regions (UK, India), explored kitchen island options both generally and specifically from IKEA, and also looked into cabinet solutions including kitchen cabinets and office filing cabinets. The searches suggest someone planning or researching furniture purchases for home organization and kitchen design. The original label appears to have been corrupted by a word-overlap error where 'island' from 'kitchen island' incorrectly bridged to 'Dental_Island', creating a completely inaccurate categorization.

## EU Settlement Scheme (mass=150.40)

This topic focuses specifically on the EU Settlement Scheme, a UK immigration program allowing EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and their families to obtain settled or pre-settled status post-Brexit. The two retained queries directly reference applying to this scheme. The dropped queries, while immigration-related, concern different processes: Schengen visas (short-term travel permits for Europe), US visas, UK travel visas, and British passport applications. These are distinct legal processes with different requirements, timelines, and outcomes from settlement schemes.

All queries demonstrate a clear interest in understanding the ongoing conflict, its background, and current developments.

## UK Settled Status (mass=142.56)

This topic captures the user's interest in UK Settled Status, specifically the EU Settlement Scheme that allows EU, EEA, and Swiss citizens to continue living in the UK after Brexit. The queries show the user is seeking information on how to check their settled status, how employers verify it, and how to access the online system. One query about translating 'employer' to German appears unrelated to the immigration status theme and was likely included due to word overlap.

## Zoom Video Conferencing (mass=126.68)

This topic captures the user's interest in Zoom video conferencing platform. The queries demonstrate practical engagement with Zoom services including downloading the software, accessing the platform (zoom.us), exploring premium subscription options, and using Zoom's cloud features. The user also searched for UK dial-in numbers, suggesting active use of Zoom's telephony features. The AI notetaker queries have been excluded as they represent separate third-party applications (Read AI and Fathom) that integrate with Zoom rather than being part of the core Zoom platform itself.

## Otta Job Platform (mass=119.26)

This topic represents user activity on Otta, a job search and career platform. The user searched for Otta generally and then specifically looked for positions at multiple companies through the platform: commercial associate roles at Cleo, finance and strategy associate positions at Deliveroo, and opportunities at Lendable and Checkout.com. All core queries show the characteristic 'otta [company]' or 'otta [company] [role]' pattern. The two dropped queries about Deliveroo pricing and the general Deliveroo search are unrelated to job searching and instead concern the food delivery service itself.

## KCL Student Records (mass=118.70)

This topic centers on King's College London student services and records management. The user has searched for KCL-specific resources including student records systems, student services at Kings, and organizing student events at the university. Off-topic queries about Apple product events, fintech conferences, iPhone discounts, and entrepreneurship programs are included only due to shared words like 'event' and 'student' but lack the core KCL administrative context. The retained queries all relate directly to KCL's student administration infrastructure and campus life organization.

## Cloud Storage Services (mass=115.93)

This topic focuses on the user's interest in cloud storage services, specifically Google Drive and OneDrive. The user has searched for information about downloading Google Drive, the Google Drive app, and OneDrive. Several queries about '1 Park Drive' and 'One Park Drive' (a residential building in Canary Wharf) appear due to word overlap with 'drive' but are off-topic for cloud storage. The ambiguous standalone query 'drive' has been removed as it lacks context to definitively place it in the cloud storage category.
